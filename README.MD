# BrudvikWhiteHilt

## Overview

BrudvikWhiteHilt is a mod for Valheim that enhances the overall game by adding custom items that makes life easy and enjoyable. Note: I made this mod as a proof of concept, and because to me - after completing Valheim a few times, it's all about building and fending off attackers. Thus I enjoy the easy ways without much hassle. Combines good with my mod: [BrudvikStackedChest](https://github.com/brudvik/BrudvikStackedChest).

All items are named after **Dyrnwyn** - a legendary white-hilted sword from Welsh mythology that would blaze with fire when drawn by a worthy man.

## Compilation

Please notice that it won't be possible to compile this `mod` out of the box. Make sure you read up on [Valheim Mod Development](https://github.com/Valheim-Modding/JotunnModStub).
There's also a directory removed from the source. The `Assets` folder is not part of the public source. The icon's I've bought from [Graphicriver.net](https://graphicriver.net/item/rpg-potion-icons/24972053) and
the license only allows it to be shipped in the pre-built mod file. If you want to make a similar `mod` you would need to buy a license from there.
